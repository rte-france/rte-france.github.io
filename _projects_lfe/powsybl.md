PowSyBl (Power System Blocks) is an open-source library written in Java, dedicated to electrical grid modeling, visualization and simulation. The power system blocks may be used through Python scripts for quick operations, but also be assembled to build state-of-the-art applications.

PowSyBl is part of the LF Energy Foundation, a project of The Linux Foundation.

One major aim of the project is to make it easy to write complex software for power system simulation and analysis.

A key characteristic of PowSyBl is its modular design, at the core of the open-source approach. It enables developers to extend or customize its features by providing their own plugins.

With PowSyBl, you can create applications that can:
- Handle a large variety of formats, such as CIM-CGMES for European data exchanges;
- Allow you to visualize the network and manipulate it endlessly;
- Perform power flow simulations and security analyses on the network;
- Optimize remedial actions in the network in order to relieve operational limits violations;
- Perform short-circuit analyses on the network;
- Perform dynamic simulations on the network.
