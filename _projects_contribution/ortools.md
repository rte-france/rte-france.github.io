OR-Tools is an open source software suite for optimization, tuned for tackling the world's toughest problems in vehicle
routing, flows, integer and linear programming, and constraint programming.

After modeling your problem in the programming language of your choice, you can use any of a half dozen solvers to solve
it: commercial solvers such as Gurobi or CPLEX, or open-source solvers such as SCIP, GLPK, or Google's GLOP and
award-winning CP-SAT.

RTE contributes to OR-Tools by developing and maintaining the support
of [FICO XPRESS](https://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization) solver.
