Phlowers is an open-source library suite for studying power lines, written in Python.

This suite includes several Python packages, available on PyPi soon:

- [mechaphlowers](https://github.com/phlowers/mechaphlowers): a package dedicated to mechanical and geometrical calculations for overhead power lines.
- [thermohl](https://github.com/phlowers/thermohl): a package focused on thermal analysis of overhead power lines.
- [Coming soon] thermophlowers: a package dedicated to determine overhead power lines ampacities from meteo forecastings.
RTE uses it to determine dynamically the permanent current limit of some strategic lines.
