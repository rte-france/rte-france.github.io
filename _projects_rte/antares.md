Antares-Simulator is a power system simulator designed for anyone who values quantifying the adequacy or economic
performance of interconnected energy systems, both in the short term and over long-term horizons. With an accurate
modeling of energy consumption, generation, and transportation, the software performs probabilistic simulations of
the system across numerous year-long scenarios, each consisting of 8,760 hourly timeframes.

Transmission System Operators, Power and Gas Producers, Regulators, Academics, Consultants, NGOs, and all other
stakeholders concerned with energy policy issues are encouraged to use the software.

It enables forecasting the optimal energy mix in each considered area, allowing users to explore numerous parameters:
- Studying forward-looking visions of the energy sector;
- Analyzing the costs and benefits of new interconnection or production projects;
- Evaluating the risks to supply security or costs;
- Measuring the impact of energy policies on the production mix.

The massive development of intermittent renewable energies, the proliferation of local experiments involving smart
grids, and the assessment of potential benefits offered by storage technologies (e.g., batteries, power-to-gas) are
typical examples of strategic issues. Analyzing these issues requires the assistance of a software application such
as Antares-Simulator.

Let's get started!
