Luciole is RTE’s Design Dystem, supporting the design and development of all digital products. It ensures consistency, quality, and reliability across our interfaces, while promoting an accessible, clean, and inclusive design for everyone.

The Design System provides:
- ready-to-use styles and components,
- best practices for design and development,
- clear and living documentation,
- two communities — designers and front-end developers — who share, exchange, and continuously evolve the system.

Its goal is to simplify design, accelerate projects, and ensure a consistent experience across RTE’s entire digital ecosystem.
