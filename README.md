# Open Source at RTE: A Dedicated Website
This GitHub Pages website provides a comprehensive overview of RTE’s involvement in Open Source. It explains the reasons behind RTE’s commitment to Open Source and highlights the various projects where RTE is actively contributing. Additionally, it serves as a central hub for accessing the GitHub repositories of our main contributions.

You can visit our website at https://opensource.rte-france.com

## Contributing to improving the website

You are welcome to suggest improvements to the overall UX / UI of the website.  
First of all, you need to as for Write access (see above). Then you can open pull requests.    
The website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with
the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.  
Most of the features are configured in the [_config?yml](_config.yml) file.  
Some custom HTML & CSS has been necessary in order to make the website look the way it does. The source code of these
customizations
is in the [_includes](_includes), [_layouts](_layouts), and [_sass](_sass) directories. These are meant to override or
augment the theme's
default resources.
