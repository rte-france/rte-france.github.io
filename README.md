## Contributing to improving the website
You are welcome to suggest improvements to the overall UX / UI of the website.  
First of all, you need to as for Write access (see above). Then you can open pull requests.    
The website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with the [minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.  
Most of the features are configured in the [_config?yml](_config.yml) file.  
Some custom HTML & CSS has been necessary in order to make the website look the way it does. The source code of these customizations 
is in the [_includes](_includes), [_layouts](_layouts), and [_sass](_sass) directories. These are meant to override or augment the theme's 
default resources.
